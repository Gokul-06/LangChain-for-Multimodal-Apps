# LangChain with SingleStoreDB and OpenAI Integration

This repository demonstrates an integration of LangChain with SingleStoreDB and OpenAI, focusing on processing and storing image captions, and utilizing OpenAI's models for generating and handling multimodal data.

## Overview

The project integrates several advanced technologies to handle and analyze image data, generate captions, and interact with AI models for rich, context-aware responses. It leverages LangChain for its language capabilities, SingleStoreDB for efficient data storage and retrieval, and OpenAI's powerful models for multimodal data processing.

## Features

- **SingleStoreDB Integration**: Utilizes SingleStoreDB to store and retrieve image-related data efficiently.
- **OpenAI Integration**: Leverages OpenAI's cutting-edge models for advanced language and image processing capabilities.
- **Image Processing**: Automates the downloading and processing of images, generating descriptive captions.
- **Multi-Modal Interaction**: Employs a multi-modal approach combining text and images to generate context-aware responses using OpenAI's models.

## Installation

Ensure you have all the necessary packages installed. Use the following command to install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install langchain openai langchain-experimental langchain-openai pillow open_clip_torch torch matplotlib transformers --quiet

Setup
Before running the script, configure your environment with the necessary credentials:
import os

# Configure SingleStoreDB connection
os.environ["SINGLESTOREDB_URL"] = 'your_singlestoredb_connection_string'

# Configure OpenAI API key
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = 'your_openai_api_key'
Replace your_singlestoredb_connection_string and your_openai_api_key with your actual SingleStoreDB connection details and OpenAI API key, respectively.

Usage
Execute the script to process images, generate captions, store data, and interact with the OpenAI model. The script performs the following operations:

Downloads an image from a specified URL.
Utilizes LangChain's ImageCaptionLoader to generate image captions.
Stores the processed image data in SingleStoreDB.
Demonstrates a multi-modal interaction with OpenAI's model, combining image data and text queries.
