# LangChain with SingleStoreDB and OpenAI Integration

This repository demonstrates an integration of LangChain with SingleStoreDB and OpenAI, focusing on processing and storing image captions, and utilizing OpenAI's models for generating and handling multimodal data.

## Overview

The project integrates several advanced technologies to handle and analyze image data, generate captions, and interact with AI models for rich, context-aware responses. It leverages LangChain for its language capabilities, SingleStoreDB for efficient data storage and retrieval, and OpenAI's powerful models for multimodal data processing.

## Features

- **SingleStoreDB Integration**: Utilizes SingleStoreDB to store and retrieve image-related data efficiently.
- **OpenAI Integration**: Leverages OpenAI's cutting-edge models for advanced language and image processing capabilities.
- **Image Processing**: Automates the downloading and processing of images, generating descriptive captions.
- **Multi-Modal Interaction**: Employs a multi-modal approach combining text and images to generate context-aware responses using OpenAI's models.

## Installation

Ensure you have all the necessary packages installed. Use the following command to install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install langchain openai langchain-experimental langchain-openai pillow open_clip_torch torch matplotlib transformers --quiet
